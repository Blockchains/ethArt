## On-chain ERC 721 deployer for Etherean Artists

Artist needs a free and fancy way to deploy Non-Fungible Tokens (ERC 721) without any line of code. 

ethArt is a simple tool to deploy and manage NFTs, with two level of decentralization:

### Distributed:

File and metadata deployed using IPFS

### Decentralized:

File deployed on-chain by BASE 64, expensive, but perpetual!

## Compatibility:

This ERC 721 contract is compatible with OpenSea and finally ethereans can create and trade Non-fungible Tokens that are really perpetual.

## Business Model:

This project is open source without any fees added, but users can donate ETH, BUIDL or USDC to the DFOhub Wallet, so every donation will increase the backed value of $BUIDL.

## Release date:

Testing Smart Contracts, soon available for everyone 

### Mainnet Deploy scheduled for June 18 2020
